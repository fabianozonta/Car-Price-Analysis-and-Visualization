# Car Price Analysis and Visualization

This project was developed with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) to help with various aspects of the project, such as cleaning data, generating visualizations, and performing analyses to better understand trends in car prices across different years and brands. The README itself was written without AI assistance.

## Overview
In this project, we work with a dataset containing information about various car models, their types, brand, MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price), and other relevant features. The goal is to:
1. Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing outliers.
2. Explore and visualize the distribution of car prices and miles per gallon.
3. Analyze the relationship between car prices and other factors, such as model year, type, and premium versions.
4. Identify the most expensive cars for each year.

## Features
- Data cleaning and outlier removal.
- Visualizations of numerical data distributions using histograms.
- Analysis of MSRP trends by brand, vehicle type, and premium versions.
- Bar chart visualizations of the most expensive cars by year and by brand.
- Grouped bar charts showing the segmentation of market prices for premium and standard versions.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have the following libraries installed:
